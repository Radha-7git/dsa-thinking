# Two Pointers Pattern

## What problem type this solves

The two pointers pattern is used when a problem involves processing elements of an array or string
by moving through it in a controlled way, instead of checking all possible pairs using brute force.

It is commonly used when we need to compare, combine, or adjust elements based on a condition,
such as expanding or shrinking a range while maintaining some property.

The key idea is that pointers move in one direction, which helps reduce unnecessary repeated work.
