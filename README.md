# DSA Thinking

This repository documents my learning of Data Structures and Algorithms with an emphasis on
problem-solving patterns, reasoning, and decision-making rather than just final solutions.

The goal of this repository is to build clarity in how and why a particular approach is chosen,
what alternatives were considered, and where common mistakes occur.

## How this repository is organized

The repository is structured by problem-solving patterns.

Each folder represents a broad pattern such as:
- Two pointers
- Recursion and backtracking
- Dynamic programming
- Graph traversal

Inside each folder:
- Explanation files describe when and why the pattern applies
- Problems (added gradually) show how the pattern is used in practice

---

## What this repository focuses on

- Recognizing patterns from problem statements  
- Translating brute-force ideas into optimized approaches  
- Designing correct base cases and state definitions  
- Identifying edge cases and common pitfalls  

The emphasis is on **thinking before coding**.

## How this repository should be used

This repository is meant to be used as:
- A reference for identifying the right approach quickly
- A record of learning progress over time

It is not intended to be a collection of all solved problems.

## Notes

Explanations are written in simple language based on my understanding at the time.
They may evolve as my clarity improves, and revisions are part of the learning process.
